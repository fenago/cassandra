#### Step 2: Explore the Database Options

Astra offers two types of serverless databases:

- **Serverless (Vector)**: Ideal for vector search applications, such
    as those used in Generative AI (GenAI), semantic search, and
    geospatial search. These databases can store vector embeddings
    alongside non-vector tabular data, making them perfect for
    applications requiring complex data retrieval, such as chatbots and
    sentiment analysis.
- **Serverless (Non-Vector)**: Designed for more generic
    applications, like content management, user authentication, and
    transactional applications. These databases provide the performance
    and reliability of Cassandra for a wide range of traditional
    workloads.

#### Step 3: Understand the Terminology

Depending on your background, you might be familiar with various terms
for database components. Astra uses specific terms that may differ based
on the database type:

- **Namespace (Vector) / Keyspace (Non-Vector)**: A container for
    collections or tables within a database.
- **Collection (Vector) / Table (Non-Vector)**: A container for
    data.
- **Document (Vector) / Row (Non-Vector)**: A piece of data stored
    within a collection or table.
- **Field (Vector) / Column (Non-Vector)**: Attributes of the data,
    such as vector dimensions or IDs.

Understanding these terms will help you navigate Astra's interface and
API more effectively.

#### Step 4: Choose Your Cloud Provider

Astra supports multiple regions across Amazon Web Services, Google
Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Depending on your location and needs, you
can deploy your database in a region that best suits your requirements.
Astra ensures high availability and low latency by allowing you to
choose from a wide range of regions, with different pricing options
depending on the region and provider.
